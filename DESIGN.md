# Design System

## Design Philosophy

loop-task is a **command-first terminal application** built on Ink 7 + React 19. The design rejects the "web app in a terminal" metaphor in favor of CLI-native patterns: a persistent command input at the bottom, keyboard-only navigation, and inline information density.

Inspired by `lazygit`, Claude Code, and `gh`, the UI prioritizes:
- **Always-focused input** at the bottom where all actions begin
- **Tab-based context switching** (Loops / Tasks / Projects) with distinct accent colors
- **Two-panel layout** (list left, detail right) with Tab cycling between them
- **Floating elements** (toasts, dropdowns, modals) that overlay content without pushing layout
- **Minimal chrome** - one status line header, one hint line footer, no decorative borders

## Color Philosophy

The palette is intentionally limited to **4 primary colors + 4 semantic + grays**. No decorative colors exist outside this set.

- **Brand** (amber `#fbbf24`) is the generic accent for UI elements that don't belong to a specific entity: app name, input bar, modal borders, command palette highlights.
- **Loop** (blue `#38bdf8`), **Task** (purple `#a78bfa`), **Project** (green `#34d399`) are entity-specific. When the active tab changes, the panel borders, filter labels, and selected-row indicators all shift to the active entity's color via `tabAccentColor()`.
- **Semantic** colors (success/warning/danger/idle) are reserved for status communication - never decorative.
- **Grays** form a 6-tone background scale and 4-tone text scale. Selected rows use `bg.active` with `text.inverse` for maximum contrast.

## Layout Architecture

The board view is a vertical stack:

1. **Header** (3 rows): App name + tagline, daemon status + loop counts + tab bar, separator line
2. **Content area** (flexGrow, full terminal width): Wide terminals (`>=110` columns) use a LeftPanel (60%) + RightPanel (40%) row. Compact terminals (`70-109` columns) stack full-width panels. Minimal terminals (`<70` columns) show the full-width navigator only. DebugPanel follows the active layout direction.
3. **Command input** (6 rows): Bordered box with accent bar, input line with inline placeholder, and hint bar

### Panel Focus Model

Panels receive focus via the `isFocused` prop (not Ink's native `useFocus()`). When focused:
- Panel border shifts to the active tab's accent color
- Arrow keys navigate within that panel's list
- Tab/Shift+Tab toggles between left and right panels (never into header or input)

When any modal is open, `isFocused` is false for both panels - blocking all arrow key input from reaching the lists behind the modal.

## Command Input

The bottom input is the heart of the interaction model. It has three modes, each with a distinct accent bar color:

- **Command mode** (amber `│`): Fuzzy autocomplete via `ink-combobox` headless hooks. Dropdown floats above the input with `position="absolute"`. Placeholder: "Start typing an action or say help..."
- **Confirm mode** (red `│`): Destructive commands transition here. Shows the confirmation prompt, offers yes/cancel options. No text input - only navigation.
- **Search mode** (green `│`): Typing "search" + Enter transitions here. Filters the active list in real-time. Placeholder: "Write something to filter about..."

The input ignores all Ctrl key combos (`if (key.ctrl) return`) - these are handled by the global `useInput` in App.tsx for shortcuts like Ctrl+N (new), Ctrl+E (edit), Ctrl+D (delete), Ctrl+P (commands browser), Ctrl+Enter (panel action), Ctrl+Arrow (tab switching).

Only single printable ASCII characters (`input.length === 1 && input >= " " && input <= "~"`) are inserted as text - this prevents multi-char sequences like `\r\n` (VS Code Ctrl+Enter) from injecting newlines.

## Forms

- **Create**: `WizardForm` - one field per screen with breadcrumb progress. Ctrl+S skips optional fields. Esc goes back one step (or cancels from step 1). Uses `FocusableInput` for text steps and arrow-key select for suggestion steps.
- **Edit**: `PatchEditForm` - read-only labeled table of all current values. The command input suggests `change <field>` commands. Selecting one activates that row's inline input. Pending changes shown with a `●` indicator and count in the header. `save` commits, `cancel` discards.

## Floating Elements

- **Toasts**: `position="absolute" bottom={0} right={0}` - float over content in the bottom-right corner. Round border, elevated background, auto-dismiss after 3.5s. Max 4 visible.
- **Command dropdown**: `position="absolute" bottom={3}` - floats above the input row without pushing layout. Selected row uses `bg.active` highlight.
- **Modals**: `position="absolute"` centered overlays with `borderStyle="round"`. Escape to close. CommandsBrowserModal is centered with search + grouped command list.
- **DebugPanel**: Optional 22% right column (toggled via "debug" command). Shows last 12 keypresses with char codes and modifier flags. Warning-yellow border.

## Key Hints

The hint bar at the bottom of the command input shows contextual shortcuts:
- Left side: `······· esc cancel` (dots as visual separator)
- Right side: `tab panels  ctrl+p commands` (command mode), `enter confirm` (confirm mode), `enter apply` (search mode)

Key hints use bold for the key label and muted for the action description.

## Status Indicators

Loop status is communicated via color:
- Running loops show a green `ink-spinner` (dots animation) inline in the list row
- Status text in the list uses semantic colors (running=green, waiting=muted, paused=yellow, idle=orange, stopped=red)
- Run history sparkline uses blue bars with success/danger streak indicators
- Run exit codes use checkmark (`✓` green) or cross (`✗` red) icons

## Constraints

- **No mouse** - Ink has no mouse API. All interaction is keyboard.
- **No CSS animations** - Terminal rendering. The only motion is `ink-spinner`.
- **Terminal-width dependent** - Responsive breakpoints: wide (`>=110` columns) uses side-by-side panels; compact (`70-109`) stacks full-width navigator and inspector panels; minimal (`<70`) shows only the full-width navigator.
- **Color compatibility** - Uses 24-bit ANSI true color. Falls back gracefully on terminals without true color support via Ink's color handling.
