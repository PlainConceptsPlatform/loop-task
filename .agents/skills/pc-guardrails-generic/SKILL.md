## Transitive loads (optimization skills)

The marker sections below may contain instructions for selected optimization skills. These are mandatory. If a section says "call `skill("xxx")`", you must call the skill tool with that exact name before doing any work.

## Secrets

- Treat `.env` files as write-only: write to them when configuring, read credentials from the environment or secret store at runtime.
- Keep credentials, API keys, and tokens out of logs and output.
- Stage secrets through environment variables or secret stores, committed only in encrypted or template form.

## Code

- Run tests before marking done.
- Run lint/build before pushing.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Comments are for WHY, not WHAT. Use them only when the code does something non-obvious or the reason cannot be inferred from context. Keep comment ratio under 10%. If more than 10% of lines in a file are comments, refactor for clarity instead.
- Each file should have one clear responsibility. Split by domain or feature (e.g. `user-constants.ts`, `order-types.ts`, `auth-config.ts`) rather than creating catch-all files like `constants.js`, `types.ts`, `config.js`, or `utils.ts` that collect unrelated things. A file that imports from many unrelated modules is a sign it should be split.

## Temporary files

- Create scratch files only under `$REPO_ROOT/.opencode/.tmp/`; create a task-specific child directory when needed.
- Keep final artifacts in their required repository path. Copy or move a scratch artifact into that path before reporting it.
- Never use operating-system temporary directories or paths outside `$REPO_ROOT`.
- Remove scratch files when the task ends unless they are needed to diagnose a failure.

## Security

- Validate all inputs.
- Escape all outputs.
- Keep credentials in environment variables or secret stores, committed only in encrypted or template form.

## Communication

- Ask for clarification if unclear.
- Report blockers immediately.
- Show progress when asked.

## RTK

- Prefix ALL CLI commands with `rtk` (e.g. `rtk git diff`, `rtk pnpm test`). Read-only commands like `cat`, `ls`, `Get-Content` are exempt.

## Simple English (optimization skill - MANDATORY LOAD)

- **You MUST call `skill("simple-english")` via the skill tool before responding.** This is not optional. Apply Simplified Technical English to all prose responses.
- Keep code blocks, identifiers, CLI commands, file paths, quoted errors, and product names exact.

<!-- PC-GUARDRAILS-HUMANIZER-START -->
## Humanizer (optimization skill — MANDATORY LOAD)

- **You MUST call `skill("humanizer")` via the skill tool before writing any prose** (commit messages, PR descriptions, docs, proposals) to remove AI writing patterns and sound more natural.
- Do NOT apply humanizer to code, config files, or terminal output: only to prose.

## Engineer workflow (when spawned)

When the lead spawns you via the task tool, your assigned task IDs and text are already in your prompt:

1. The `pc-system-reminders` plugin has already loaded the skills listed under your `## Abilities`, guardrails first.
2. Gather context using the project-selected tools described above.
3. Implement your assigned tasks in dependency order. Edit only files within your assigned scope.
4. Run the project's tests/lint before marking done (see Code above).
5. Record the task result through the project-selected workflow.
6. Return a summary containing: task IDs done, files changed, tests/lint result, and any decisions made. Then you exit; you do not poll, claim, or wait for more work.
